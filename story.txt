There used to be a mountain and there was a temple on the mountain. There was a little monk asking an old monk to tell him a story. So the old monk in the temple telling a story to the little monk.

The old monk said, "there used to be a mountain and a temple on the mountain, there was a little monk asking an old monk to tell him a story..."

The little monk became hungry and grew impatient, and as the old monk was telling his story, the little monk quietly snuck away to eat the fruits from the nearby trees. On his way he tripped and fell and hurt himself, and the old monk took care of him, reminding the little monk that the safest place was on the mountain.
